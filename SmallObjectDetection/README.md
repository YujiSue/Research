# Small object detection using UNET image segmentation

## Introduction
### Purpose
- Detect and count objects that are small enough compared to the image size  
ex. nematode eggs on a dish
![]()

### What's problem
- Signs of movement and/or life activity of animals are reflected in the images.  
- A large number of images must be analyzed when a microscope is used to take images with a magnification high enough to easily detect small objects.
=> Want to detect targets efficiently from as few images as possible!
